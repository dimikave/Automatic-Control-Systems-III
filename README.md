# Automatic-Control-Systems-III
Project for Automatic Control Systems III Course / Aristotle University of Thessaloniki / Winter Semester 2020

## Part 1
### Description:

- Running a simulation of a closed loop system (ode45)
  i) with and ii) without a discontinuous nonlinearity
  using a) step function b) ramp function
  as input
- Conclude about system stability

## Part 2
### Description:

Trajectory Planning of 2-link Robot Manipulator using:
 - A) Feedback Linearization	
 - B) Sliding Mode Control

## Status of the project
As of the completion of the project, it will probably NOT be maintained. Future projects regarding robot links and sliding mode control could be implemented using parts of this code though. It may hold inaccuracies and could be implemented in more efficient ways regarding speed and recources management.
